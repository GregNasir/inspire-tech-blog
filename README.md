## Description

Inspire Tech Blog provides readers with insights on the ins and outs of web development. By taking deep dives into both front and back-ends, coding intracacies are explored; helping fellow developers to manuever. Various tools were used to create this webpage. They were:

* Javascript 
* Express
* MySql
* Heroku
* npm modules
* handlebars
* dotenv package
* Run tests using nmp jest
* Timely commits to GitHub repository to save work

Using handlebars is an easier and effective way to render code to html scripts. Working on this project exposed me to proper usage of this tool.
